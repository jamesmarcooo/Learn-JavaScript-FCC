// Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
// When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
// >
// Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.

//   Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
//   >
//   Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.
